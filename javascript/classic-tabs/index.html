          <h4>Mountains</h4>
          <p>
            Mountains often serve as geographic features that define natural
            borders of countries. Their height can influence weather patterns,
            stalling storms that roll off the oceans and squeezing water from
            the clouds. The other side is often much drier. The rugged
            landscapes even provide refuge—and protection—for fleeing and
            invading armies.

          <h4>Forest</h4>
          <p>
            Forest ecosystems can be found in all regions capable of sustaining
            tree growth, at altitudes up to the tree line, except where natural
            fire frequency or other disturbance is too high, or where the
            environment has been altered by human activity.

          <h4>Lakes</h4>
          <p>
            Hutchinson presented in his publication a comprehensive analysis of
            the origin of lakes and proposed what is a widely accepted
            classification of lakes according to their origin. This
            classification recognizes 11 major lake types that are divided into
            76 subtypes. The 3 of 11 major lake types are:
