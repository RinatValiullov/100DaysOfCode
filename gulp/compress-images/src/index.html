        <p class="card__description">
          Deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range,
          with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night. The diurnal
          range may be as much as 20 to 30 °C (36 to 54 °F) and the rock surface
          experiences even greater temperature differentials.

        <p class="card__description">
          Heights of mountains are typically measured above sea level. Using
          this metric, Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, at 8,848
          metres (29,029 ft).
